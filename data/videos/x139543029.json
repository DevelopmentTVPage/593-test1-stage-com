    "description": "Milla, Aimee, Claudia... They each have their own way of expressing the close relationship they have with their True Match foundation. Why? Because, in reality, at the time of filming, each of them wrote something that was personal to them, about the people in their lives that are dear to them. Four poetic conversations, four metaphors of love and a charming nod to a unique advertising campaign.\nAim\u00e9e Mullins confides her feelings about being in love. The extraordinary and fascinating spokeswoman reveals her thoughts about the power of love on self-confidence and inner as well as outer beauty, in a touchingly true confession.\n\nFind us on Instagram http:\/\/instagram.com\/lorealparisusa\nLike us on Facebook! https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LOrealParisUSA\nFollow us on twitter! @LOrealParisUSA https:\/\/twitter.com\/LOrealParisUSA",
